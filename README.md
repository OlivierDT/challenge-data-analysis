# challenge-data-analysis

"Immo Eliza" challenge to predict prices for the Belgian real estate market.

## Description

This challenge encompasses:

### 1. Data cleaning

From raw data to data that can be exploited for building a pricing model.

The data should have (1) no duplicates, (2) no blank spaces, (3) no errors, and (4) no empty values.

Let's do some (heavy?) cleaning!

### 2. Data analysis

Once the data is clean, it is time to slice and dice it to gain some insights into the factors that influence the real estate prices.

### 3. Data interpretation

Then, it is time to interpret the data and explain your findings.
